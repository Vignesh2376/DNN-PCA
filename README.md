Proposed methodology utilizes a pre-trained Deep Neural Network (DNN) to extract relevant features in the input data.
Once the features are extracted, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to reduce the dimensions of the feature space. 
PCA reduces the amount of information to be used in the model, while eliminating certain redundant dimensional space to help generalize the model.
Experiments were conducted using the Cleveland heart disease dataset from the UCI repository, which contains 297 cleaned records and 13 commonly used features. 
The model gavean accuracy of %91.
